						<h3>Starting Game Design:</h3>
						<div class="wrapper">
							
							
							
						</div>
						

So you wanna start making games?  That is a very good idea. Most people don't know where to start. That is because there are less number of people who want to make games. Why is that so?? Why aren't there more people?? Is it so tough? or is it so bad and boring?? - These are the thoughts of people who want to start game making but don't even know what programming is. I'll start discussing about how to start game design but before that, there is something important - Why do most people fail in making  proper games?? Yes, you must have seen some people who made(tried to make) games for a while but left the whole "Game Development" thing after a while.<br>

<br><h3>Why do people fail in making games??</h3><br>
Yes! why does this happen? Well, this isn't a big mystery which only Sherlock Holmes can solve. Main reasons for failure:<br>

<h2>1. Diving in the sea without knowing its depth:</h2> Many people get fascinated after playing some great games. So, they dream of making a Crysis or Assasins Creed without knowing anything about game programming. Sadly, game making isn't as easy as playing a game. <br>

<h2>2.Improper planning:</h2>  A beginner's Question- Where should I start?? <br><br>
There are plenty of Gamemaking softwares, Game Engines and Programming languages.<br>
We should be careful while choosing them properly. Choosing an option which is higher than our level makes it very difficult to cope up and choosing an option which is below our skill-level stunts our development.<br> 
<br>This is where Magnetic Thumbs can help you. Given is the list of Game Making Options with the required Skill-level.<br>

<br><br><h2>Beginners:</h2> These 'softwares' are for them, who are new to game design and programming. The softwares below emphasize on basic level design and will not require programming knowledge.<br><br>

<h3>1.Scratch: </h3><br>
 
The best option for any person who wants to learn basic concepts of programming. This is a visual programming software which is free of syntax. So when there is no syntax, there are very less chances of making errors (unless if the very logic is wrong). Think of an algorithm in the mind and just deploy it. No rules, No methods to follow. This increases the creativity and removes the barrier of syntax.It creates online JAVA based games.<br>
<h3><br>My rating: 8.0/10<br></h3>
<h2><h2>Summary:</h2></h2> Excellent for kids who want to start programming.<br><br>

<h3>2.Engine 001:</h3> This is one of my personal favorites. Create 2D games with no programming skills. Well, If you want to make a better game, you can program in the 001 game engine. Another advantage of Engine 001 is that it has a very active community with plenty of new game assets produced every now and then.<br><br>
<h3>My rating: 7.5/10</h3><br>
<h2>Summary:</h2> Can make convincible 2D action/RPG games within less time.<br><br>

<h3>3.Raycasting Game Maker:</h3> This is my favourite engine but there are only few people who'll care to play the games made with this engine. RGM is a Raycasting game engine.(Raycasting Games Ex: Wolfestein 3D, Doom etc.). Most people infer that it is an outdated engine but the games made by RGM run on Windows Vista and Windows 7 with absolutely no problems!!.<br><br>
The Advantages of RGM are:<br>
1. Make games very easily. No need to program anything.<br>
2.No need to model characters or ingame entities. Just paint them using a paint tools. No direct X<br>
3.Almost plays on most of the computers without problems.<br>
<br>
The disadvantage of RGM are:<br>
1.Its graphics are old but the engine is great.The engine is a raycasting type so, we cannot compare its output with a software like Unreal Engine,FPS Creator.<br>
2.With almost the same effort made,users can create much better games using FPS Creator or The 3D Gamemaker.<br>
But for advanced users, its better to create their own engine or make games using Doom or wolfenstein 3D engine as they are highly advanced.<br>
<br>
<h3>My Rating: 6.5/10<br></h3>
<h2>Summary:</h2> Just paint the enemies and rooms.Much better for non-programmers.  I have been using this engine for more than five years and had no complaints.<br>
<br>
<h3>4.The 3D Gamemaker:</h3> First of all, I don't want to include it on this list. Create player option in FIFA games have more customising options than this "Game Creation Tool". All the characters, levels and other entities are already made by the developers. Our only job is to select characters, levels and entities from the given list and click on 'make game'. <br><br>
The official website says : "You can literally make a game with just 'one' mouse click " - Yes, but I don't think that would be called a game. Frankly speaking, it cannot even convince a five year old kid that he made a 'game'. <br>
<h3>My rating : 3/10<br></h3>
<h2>Summary:</h2>  A sheer waste of money. It needs an additional license of  99 USD for every commercial game you make apart from the money you spent on buying it.<br><br>

<h3>5.Game Editor: </h3>Game editor is a cross platform game maker. It is easy to use and games made on it can be exported to Windows, Mac, Mobile and few other platforms. <br>
<br>
<h3>My rating: 6.8/10<br></h3>
<h2>Summary:</h2> Game Editor is good for beginners but is commercial.<br><br>

<h1>Here ends the Beginner Section.</h1><br><br>

<h3>Lite:</h3> - Okay, Now I've understood the basic concepts of gaming. I want to start making  games with more of my influence with better gameplay.The softwares below emphasize on level design and require less programming knowledge.<br><br>

<h3>1.Game Maker 8: </h3>This is one of the most popular game making softwares available.<br>
I've included this in the lite section instead of beginner section because GMK has been improved a lot. We can even create 3D shooters using Gamemaker 8. It's capability has increased a lot. It has optional programming with its own language GML.<br>
<h3>My rating: 8.1/10<br></h3>
<h2>Summary:</h2> One of the best ways to learn game design. <br><br>

<h3>2.Construct 2:</h3> Construct 2 is a good alternative to the gamemaker 8. We can use Construct -2 to make HTML5 games. It has an amazing physics engine.<br>
<h3>My rating: 7.8/10<br></h3>
<h2>Summary:</h2> Create awesome HTML5 games with no programming skills.<br>
<br>
<h3>3.Multimedia Fusion 2:</h3>  It is used to create 2D games, Screensavers and presentations. It is very powerful but it is a bit complex when compared to the gamemaker 8 or construct 2. It is commercial and costly.<br>
<h3>My rating : 7/10<br></h3>
<h2>Summary:</h2> With many other better alternatives, users may not be bothered to use MMF2 unless they are bored of gamemaker 8 or construct 2.<br><br>

<h3>4.FPS Creator: </h3> It is a great software for developing games. No programming skills are necessary to make games using FPSC. This is their main tagline and people mostly buy FPS Creator for this purpose only. FPSC has its internal scripting language which is good.  But the fact is that the games made with pre- programmed scripts are not fit to get into the market. They almost lack everything that is required to make a game success. Especially Artificial Intelligence(AI). Many new scripts are being developed every day by the members. <br><br>
FPS Creator X10, a sequel has been released which has great features and better graphics including Ragdolls.<br>
<br>
The negatives of FPS Creator X10 when compared to FPS Creator are:<br>
1. Few compatibility issues with the computers.<br>
2. Games made with FPSC and FPSCX10 lag on slower computers.(They need very good computers for good performance of game. FPSC X10  actually increased this problem.<br>
3. As FPSC is present from a longtime, it has more active forums, Compatible Mods.<br>
<br>
<h3>My Rating:<br></h3>
Without scripting: 6/10 (5 points for graphics only)<br>
Making a game with custom made scripts/third party scripts: 7.8/10<br>
Well you cannot actually edit every pixel of the game with this editor. <br>
<br>
Note:  You can get the source code with DarkBasic Pro.<br>
<br><br>
<h3>3.Experienced:</h3> In this section, the game designers need to change their base from level design to game programming. From here, we require a team to make games. A team must have level designers,Game programmers and Artists (create content). Every department has its own importance from here. This is proper game development.  Generally, game engines are used to simplify this process. You look after the level design and game logic. It takes care of rendering,game physics etc.<br>
<h3>1.Unreal Development Kit:</h3> This is the same engine that was used to create Batman: Arkham Asylum, Gears of War and UT3. Now, you've got the chance to use it for free. What will you do with it. UDK is easy to use and the output is very impressive. It uses Kismet- a visual scripting language. It even has its own language - Unreal script.<br>
<br>
<h3>My rating: 9.3/10<br></h3>
<h2>Summary:</h2> UDK has two qualities which aren't generally together- Ease of use and Powerful. <br>
<br><br>
<h3>2.Cry Engine:</h3> It is powerful than Unreal engine. C++ and lua knowledge is required. C++ is used to create own custom dlls and lua is for low level programming such as Multiplayer, Entities etc. FlowGraph is used for the whole game logic (triggers, effects, AI behaviour etc.) and can be used without any coding skills, because it's entirely graphical.<br>
<h3>My Rating: 9.5/10<br></h3>
<h2>Summary:</h2> Very powerful but requires C++ knowledge. <br><br>
<h3>3.Unity:</h3> Unity runs on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X, and the games it produces can be run on Windows, Mac, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii,iPad, iPhone,as well as the Android platform. It can also produce browser games that use the Unity web player plugin, supported on Mac and Windows and coming to Linux. It can even export its games to Adobe Flash. The users can program in C#,Java Script or Boo. The rendering quality of unity is less when compared to Unreal engine or CryEngine.<br>
<h3>My rating: 8.8/10<br></h3>
<h2>Summary:</h2> 1.Very good for beginners of game programming.<br>2.All the options are not available for the free version.
<br>
<h3>4.Pygame and Blender:</h3> Both are python based game engines.Python is very simple yet powerful language. The games created using Pygame or Blender may not be of professional quality but they are being used by many Indie programmers world wide.<br>
<h3>My rating: 8.0/10<br></h3>
<h2>Summary:</h2> Very easy to learn when compared to C++ or C# based engines.<br>
<br>
<h3>5.Darkbasic:</h3> This is based on the basic language. DarkBasic is an easy language to learn and to use. Darkbasic has many additional softwares to it like Darkbasic Pro, Dark GDK or the App Game Kit. Once again,the games created using Darkbasic may not be of professional quality but they are being used by many programmers world wide.<br>
<h3>My rating: 7.9/10</h3><br>
<h2>Summary:</h2> Even Darkbasic is an easy language to learn, Python is easier and powerful. So python based engines get additional points. In the other features, both are nearly equal.<br>
<br><br>
"There are even other Engines like Torque, Id. Tech 4 which we will not be discussing about. Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) is a cross-platform multimedia library designed to provide fast access to the graphics framebuffer and audio device. It is also used to create 2D games."<br>
<br> 
<h3>4.Advanced: </h3>The next level is pretty advanced stuff. In this level, the help done by the computer to the programmer is minimal. We have to code everything by ourselves. <br>
<h3>1.XNA Game Studio:</h3> It is a framework which uses C# to build games for Windows PC,Windows Phone and XBox 360.<br>
<br>
<h3>What is the difference between a 'game engine' and a 'framework'??</h3><br>
<br>
It is very simple. <br>
A framework is just a foundation to build your game on it.<br>
A game engines does most of the work for you. They have Terrain editors,Level editors etc. and they handle the rendering part and game physics part.<br>
<br>
So,This ends the guide. We have discussed about 17 game making options for you. Hope you liked it and found something useful.
