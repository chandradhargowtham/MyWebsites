		<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
		
		<p> I'm a twenty five year old programmer living in Hyderabad, India. My main skills are Game Design, website design, graphic design such as creating logos, game art and characters for my games and websites. 
			 <h1>TIMELINE</h1>
<h1>[<span>2007</span>]</h1>
<p>The idea of becoming a game designer struck me in 2007.From my childhood, I was interested in computers. I always <br>thought - how would a machine made by silicon and metal pieces obey our commands, give suggestions and calculate<br> so fast?? This doubt led me into learning many things about a computer.</p>

<h1>[<span>2008-10</span>]</h1>

<p>Started game design as a kid. They were always backed with positive feedbacks but were never published (Who would<br> publish games designed by a Kid??)</p>
<h1>[<span>2012 February</span>]</h1>

<p>Started "Magnetic Thumbs". This is an exclusive website for game design tutorials and webdesign tips.</p>
<h1>[<span>2012 March</span>]</h1>

<p>Started Web design services.Earlier, I created www.Chandradhar.com just for fun. Now this is my profile.I've developed <br>a few websites for individuals as a hobby for very low prices or for nothing.But they were very happy with the result.Till <br>then I had only a game design studio in mind. but all their positive feedback made me do this!</p>

<h1>[<span>2013 </span>]</h1>

<p>Started Misplaced Minds, a gaming startup. Misplaced Minds also trained hundreds of students in game development. We conducted around 11 gaming and web development workshops in the span of 2 years.</p>
<h1>[<span>2018</span>]</h1>

<p>Till date Misplaced Minds has pubished 8 games, 2 web projects and 2 freelance projects for reputed institutions in Hyderabad,India.</p>
