		<h1>Ongoing Projects</h1>
		<p>I am currently working on three projects. Firstly, I brought down majority of tutorials from Magnetic Thumbs as I am<br> making interactive tutorials. Reading E-books is a thing but learning something when the tutorial is interactive is much <br>better. I am currently working on new series of tutorials on DarkBasic Pro Game Design, PhP, HTML5 and CSS 3.0.<br><br>After that, I plan to finish the game I have started. It is Blood Thirst.Only the world building and compiling is left. I have <br>already made the game but am really dissatisfied by the levels. So I am re-designing the levels. It is a survival<br> horror game. <br><br> Next, I want to focus on creating some new music. I already have some pieces composed but would like to improvise on <br>them and re-record.
		<h1>Future Projects</h1>
		<p>1.  &nbspI am planning to design games for Android platform using JAVA. <br>2. All the future tutorials on Magnetic Thumbs would be interactive.<br>3. I am also planning to make video tutorials for beginner guitar players. The tutorials would be in such a way that <br>&nbsp a person who has no knowledge in playing guitar should be able to play metal music. 
			 <h1>Are you talented?</h1>
<p>You can help me in my projects and games. If a game is published, the profit would be shared by the entire team. So<br> think about it. If you are a talented musician, You can help me in composing or digitally altering it. If you are good at<br> any programming language, you can create content in Magnetic Thumbs and the website revenue is shared by the <br>content creators.</p>
